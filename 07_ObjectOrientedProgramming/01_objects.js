// Create a Basic JavaScript Object
/*
Objects in JavaScript are used to model real-world objects, giving them
properties and behavior just like their real-world counterparts. Here's an
example using these concepts to create a duck object:

let duck = { 
    name: "Aflac", 
    numLegs: 2
};

This duck object has two property/value pairs: a name of Aflac and a numLegs of
2.

*/

let dog = {
    name: "berkin",
    numLegs: 4
};

// Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object

console.log("Dog name: " + dog.name + "\nNumber of legs: " + dog.numLegs);
