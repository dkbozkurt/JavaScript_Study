// Implement Binary Search
/*
Binary search is an O(log(n)) efficiency algorithm for searching a sorted array
to find an element. It operates using the following steps:

Find the middle value of a sorted array. If value == target return true (The
value has been found and the search is complete). If middle value < target,
search right half of array in next compare. If middle value > target, search
left half of array in next compare. If after searching the whole array the value
is not present, return false (The array has been searched and the value is not
in the array). As you can see, you are successively halving an array, which
gives you the log(n) efficiency. For this challenge, we want you to show your
work - how you got to the target value... the path you took!

Write a function binarySearch that implements the binary search algorithm on an
array, returning the path you took (each middle value comparison) to find the
target in an array.

The function takes a sorted array of integers and a target value as input. It
returns an array containing (in-order) the middle value you found at each
halving of the original array until you found the target value. The target value
should be the last element of the returned array. If the value is not found,
return the string Value Not Found.

For example, binarySearch([1,2,3,4,5,6,7], 5) would return [4,6,5].

For this challenge, when halving, you MUST use Math.floor() when doing division:
Math.floor(x/2). This will give a consistent, testable path.

Note: The following array will be used in tests:

const testArray = [
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
  23, 49, 70
];
*/

function binarySearch(array, target) {

    let low = 0;
    let high = array.length - 1;
    let path = [];

    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        path.push(array[mid]);

        if (array[mid] === target) {
            return path;
        } else if (array[mid] < target) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return "Value Not Found";
}

const testArray = [
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
    23, 49, 70
];
let target = 5;
let res = binarySearch(testArray, target);
console.log(res);
