<!-- Create a Module Scripts

ES6 introduced a way to easily share code among JavaScript files. 
This involves exporting parts of a file for use in one or more other 
files, and importing the parts you need, where you need them. In 
order to take advantage of this functionality, you need to create 
a script in your HTML document with a type of module. Hereâ€™s an 
example:

<script type="module" src="filename.js"></script>

A script that uses this module type can now use the import and export features you will learn about in the upcoming challenges.
